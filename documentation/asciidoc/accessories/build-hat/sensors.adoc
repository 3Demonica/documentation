== Sensors

=== Working with the Colour Sensor

Connect a Colour sensor sensor to port B on the Build HAT, and a Force sensor to port C.

If you’re not intending to drive a motor, then you don’t need an external power supply and you can use a standard USB power supply for your Raspberry Pi.

Create another new program:

[source,python,linenums]
----
from signal import pause
from buildhat import ForceSensor, ColorSensor

button = ForceSensor('C')
cs = ColorSensor('B')

def handle_pressed():
    cs.on()
    print(c.get_color())

def handle_released():
    cs.off()
----

Run it and hold a coloured object (LEGO elements are ideal) in front of the colour sensor and press the Force sensor plunger. The sensor’s LED should switch on and the name of the closest colour should be displayed in the thonny REPL.
