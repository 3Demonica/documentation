== Introducing the Build HAT

The Build HAT is part of an exciting new collaboration between the Raspberry Pi Foundation and LEGO® Education to increase the impact and reach of STEAM learning.​ 

The Build HAT is an add-on board for your Raspberry Pi that connects to the 40-pin GPIO header and can be used to control up to four LEGO® Technic™ motors and sensors from the SPIKE™ Portfolio.

The HAT works with all 40-pin GPIO Raspberry Pi boards, including Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi Zero. With the addition of a ribbon cable or other extension device, it can also be used with Raspberry Pi 400.
