== .NET - Installing Software

You can either install .NET on your Raspberry Pi and code from it, either you can install on an other device and copy your build code on it. 
This installation give will guide you on how to install the needed toolchain on your Raspberry Pi. This one command line is coming from https://www.petecodes.co.uk/install-and-use-microsoft-dot-net-5-with-the-raspberry-pi/[Pete Codes].

[.bash]
----
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjgpetecodes/dotnet5pi/master/install.sh | sudo bash
----

Then you need to add the nuget packages:

[.bash]
----
dotnet add package System.Device.Gpio --source https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dotnet/IoT/_packaging/nightly_iot_builds/nuget/v3/index.json
dotnet add package Iot.Device.Bindings --source https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dotnet/IoT/_packaging/nightly_iot_builds/nuget/v3/index.json
----

Once this is done, you can now create a project and edit it. The previous article will give you all the basics to work with it.
