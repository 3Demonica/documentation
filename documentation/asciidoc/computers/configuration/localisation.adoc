== Localising your Raspberry Pi

You can set your Raspberry Pi up to match your regional settings.

=== Changing the Language

If you've installed Raspberry Pi OS using NOOBS, it should automatically pick up the same language you were using within NOOBS. But if you want to select a different language, or if you've installed Raspberry Pi OS from a standalone image, use xref:configuration.adoc#change-locale[raspi-config].

=== Configuring the Keyboard

If you've installed Raspberry Pi OS using NOOBS, it should automatically pick up the same keyboard you were using in NOOBS. But if you want to select a different keyboard, or if you've installed Raspberry Pi OS from a standalone image, use xref:configuration.adoc#change-keyboard-layout[raspi-config].

=== Changing the Timezone

Once again, this is something you can change using the xref:configuration.adoc#change-timezone[raspi-config] tool.
