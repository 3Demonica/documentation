== Blink an LED

The first program anyone writes when using a new microcontroller is to blink an LED on and off. The Raspberry Pi Pico comes with a single LED on-board (connected to GPIO pin 25).

You can blink this on and off by,

. Download the Blink UF2
. Push and hold the BOOTSEL button and plug your Pico into the USB port of your Raspberry Pi or other computer.
. It will mount as a Mass Storage Device called RPI-RP2.
 .Drag and drop the Blink UF2 binary onto the RPI-RP2 volume.
 .Pico will reboot, and the on-board LED should start blinking.

== Say "Hello World"

The next program anyone writes is to say 'Hello World' over a USB serial connection.

. Download the 'Hello World' UF2.
. Push and hold the BOOTSEL button and plug your Pico into the USB port of your Raspberry Pi or other computer.
. It will mount as a Mass Storage Device called RPI-RP2.
. Drag and drop the 'Hello World' UF2 binary onto the RPI-RP2 volume. Pico will reboot
. Open a Terminal window and type:
+
[source]
------
sudo apt install minicom
minicom -b 115200 -o -D /dev/ttyACM0
------

You should see 'Hello, world!' printed to the Terminal
